Hello! My name is Yoav Luft and today I'm going to talk about whether the JavaScript community adopts functional
programming or not. 
--

== The Beginning 

image::images/sunrise.jpg[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
About five years ago I worked for company that processed huge amounts of data on distributed Python servers. Hoping to
improve performance, I came along Erlang and Elixir, which introduced me to functional programming. Combined with my
passion for clean and verifiable code, and the trust I put into formal methods, I quickly found myself sucked to the
world of functional programming, and especially Haskell and Elm.
--


=== The Conflict

image::images/angry-husky.jpg[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
But one workplace later I met a group of developers who were not impressed by my Functional-Fu and my declarative-jutsu.
In fact, they complained that my code is too declarative! This through me off balance, and made me ask, "Is Functional
Programming Really is the future of JavaScript?"

[NOTE.speaker]

This talk is based on a research I'm conducting on coding style in Javascript. I conduct the
research independently but under the supervision of Prof. Feitelson from the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem. The results that I'll show today are preliminary, and we'll be subject to more thorough
investigation.

JavaScript Becomes [.line-through]#Functional# Declarative
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
By looking at Github's one hundred most popular javascript projects, analyzing their code and
dependencies, I feel quite convinced that as the years go on, the Javascript community is adopting a
more declarative programming style.

How did I manage to get to this conclusion? What it has to do with functional programming, and why even look at
javascript and not, say, C#? All of that and more, next.

But first,

== Introduction

[NOTE.speaker]
--

I'm Yoav Luft, born and raised in Israel, currently living with my partner Dafna in Stockholm Sweden. I've have been
programming professionally for the last ten or so years, working mostly with web applications but also with games,
embedded systems and other bits'n'pieces.

Other than programming itself, I'm also involved with the programming community as much as I can. In Israel I've founded
"FLIP", the first functional programming conference in Israel, now preparing for its second round.

I've organized the Elm users group meetups for a while, and I was part of the organizing team of
"HackExtend", a diversity centered hackathon founded by my partner Dafna and friends.

I currently work for the digital agency "Prototyp", a code lab that build code for costumers that want to break new
grounds.

Why should we even care about JavaScript? And especially, why should we talk about it in a functional programming
conference?
--

== The Past and Present of Javascript

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's start with a brief history of JavaScript: Javascript was created at netscape in 1995 after Brenden Eich (AiK), who
was originally hired to integrate Scheme into the Netscape Navigator, created a prototype in 10 days. It uses a
curly-braces like syntax because management had decided that they want a Java-like programming language. It's goal was
to allow running programs in a web-browser, making web pages interactive, and allowing for a ubiquitous platform.

[NOTE.speaker]

Javascript was created with imperative structural syntax similar to C, using control structures such as if-else blocks,
while and for loops. It has functions as first class citizens and supports closures. It is a universally typed language,
aka "dynamically" typed, but also supports some version of object oriented structuring with the use of prototypical
inheritance. 
--

[.step]
- Imperative
- Functions are 1st class citizens
- Universally typed
- Prototypical Inheritance

=== !

[source, javascript]
----
var object = 
  { name: "Object1",
    action: function() { },
    data: [1, 2, 3]
  }
JSON.stringify(object) == 
  "{\"name\":\"Object1\",\"data\":[1,2,3]}"

=== Delegation

[source, javascript]
----
function Dog() {
  this.voice = "Woof!"
  this.makeSound = function() {
    return this.voice
  }
}
var dog = new Dog
var cat = {voice: "Prrrr",
           makeSound: dog.makeSound}
cat.makeSound() == "Prrrr"
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
It uses the hashmap as its fundamental data-type, which can also be encoded to a data transfer representation, the JSON
format. It uses late-binding, and allows delegation by the use of the "this" keyword, a feature notoriously confusing
for programmers who come from other imperative-object-oriented languages such as Java.

=== But why should we care?

// video::images/why.mp4[options="loop,nocontrols,autoplay"]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
But then again, why should we care, when discussing Javascript in the context of functional programming? 
--

== JavaScript for Functional Programming

[NOTE.speaker]
--
First and foremost, we should note that javascript is a very welcoming language for the flexible functional programmer:
It supports anonymous functions and closures; It *uses* continuation passing and structured modeling of asynchronous code
quite often;
--

Javascript has:

[%step]
- anonymous functions
- closures
- uses continuation passing
- structured modeling of async (almost monads!)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
It appears that many members of the EMCA Technical Commitee 39, the committee in charge of the javascript standard, would
like to encourage functional programming style in javascript. 
As people interested in functional programming, I can only awesome that we would all like to use familiar and beloved
programming style over an imperative, out-styled, and appearently more error prone style. This is especially true if our
daily work requires writing code that would run on web browsers.
--

=== Rapidly Evolving Standard

[NOTE.speaker]
--
And it's rapidly evolving standard includes support for things such as shorthand notation for anonymous
functions (already commonly used), destructuring assignments, constant references, generator functions, and there are
even pending proposals for tail-call optimization, pipe-operator, partial application syntax and pattern matching.

== Part II: What does pass:q[<br>] [lightblue]#"Adopting functional programming"# pass:q[<br>] even mean?

=== !

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Just a short google search with the words "Javascript functional programming" will turn out millions of results,
and many of the top results are blog posts about Javascript, or functional programming in javascript.

But is that a proof that the community as a whole adopts functional programming? Or are these just functional
programming eccentrics howling at the moon?
--

image::images/blogs.gif[role="no-border-transparent"]

=== !

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We can break our question to two parts:

Let's start with "adopting"
--

[.fragment]#Adopting# {nbsp} {nbsp} [.fragment]#functional programming#

== Adopting

[%step]
. Functional programming was not popular, or formally accepted in Javascript
. It is now becoming more popular, or being formally accepted

// [quote, Merriam-Webster Dictionary]
// ____
// *adopt verb*
// 
// \ ə-ˈdäpt  \ adopted; adopting; adopts
// 
// Definition of adopt [transitive verb]
// 
// . to take by choice into a relationship especially: to take voluntarily (a child of other parents) as one's own child
// . to take up and practice or use adopted a moderate tone
// . to accept formally and put into effect adopt a constitutional amendment
// . to choose (a textbook) for required study in a course
// . to sponsor the care and maintenance of
//     adopt a highway
// ____

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Above is the Merriam-Webster definition for adopting.

In adopting some programming style we imply two things:


--

=== !

image::images/piece-of-cake.gif[background, size=cover]

== Functional Programming

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Now let us look at the second part of my statement: *Functional programming*.

What is, exactly, functional programming? How can we define it, and how can we turn such definition to concrete test
cases that we can use to determine "how much" Javascript is functional programming?

--

=== How much is JavaScript functional programming

[NOTE.speaker]
--
When in doubt regarding definitions, I do what every millennial does: I look it up in wikipedia. The wikipedia
definition was a bit mouthful, I will not read it out loud, but just notice the underlined bits:

--

[.step]
. Computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions
. Avoids changing-state and mutable-data
. Declarative programming paradigm

// [quote, Wikipedia]
// ""
// [...] functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of
// computer programs—that treats [underline]#computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions# and
// [underline]#avoids changing-state and mutable data#. It is a [underline]#declarative programming paradigm#, which means
// programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a
// function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same
// value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time[...]
// ""

=== Criteria

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's see if we can turn them into criteria for estimating how "functional" is a language or a piece of code.
--

video::images/chosen.mp4[options="loop,nocontrols,autoplay"]

// [quote, Math Insight, https://mathinsight.org/definition/function]
// ____
// A technical definition of a function is: a relation from a set of inputs to a set of possible outputs where each input
// is related to exactly one output.
// ____

=== Criterion 1: pass:q[<br/>] Computation of Mathematical Functions

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's start with "Computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions". What are "mathematical functions" in this
context? Again, from definitions, a mathematical functions is a relation from a set of input to a
set of possible outputs where each input is related to exactly one output.

OK! That's tangible! Let's try and formalize this to a criterion:

A piece of code is more "functional programming" if it uses more mathematical functions.

A mathematical function is such function that its output depends entirely on its arguments.

While simple, alas, determining such thing for arbitrary Javascript code was a bit out of scope for my research.
--

Mathematical 

[source, javascript]
----
function append(array, x) {
  return array.concat(x)
}
var a1 = [1, 2]
var a2 = append(a1, 3)
// a1 == [1, 2]; a2 == [1, 2, 3]
----

=== Non-mathematical

[source, javascript]
----
var array = [1, 2]
function append(x) {
  array.push(x)
}
append(3) // undefined -> no return
          // array == [1, 2, 3]
----


=== Criterion 2: pass:q[<br/>] Avoid changing state and mutable-data

image::images/smoke.jpg[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
I think this one is both simple and complex at the same time. It is simple because mutability and changing state are
strongly related, and very intuitive to grasp. This is complex because [a] all useful programs perform state changes; [b]
it is difficult to tell apart, when doing static analysis of code, whether a data mutation is done in-order to achieve a
desired side-effect or whether it is due to the implementation of an algorithm.

Luckily for us, we've got some help: Many javascript projects use 3rd party packages to provide immutable data structures.
Javascript also added the "const" keyword for immutable reference, and the `Object.freeze()` method for making
objects immutable at runtime. All three can be good and easy to gather indicators for how immutability is common in
javascript.
--

=== Immutability

image::images/immutablejs.png[role="no-border"]


== Criterion 3: pass:q[<br/>] Declarative Programming Paradigm

[NOTE.speaker]
--
And last but not least, we can look at whether projects adopt a declarative style of programming. Again, a definition is
in order:

While this might sound as vague as the previous definitions, I find that the last bit in there is key:
--

[quote, Wikipedia]
____
a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without
describing its control flow.
____

=== !

[quote]
____
[...] without describing its control flow.
____

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Javascript, being a language that uses C style imperative structures, comes with a nice set of control flow structures:
--

=== While loops 

// .While Loops
[source, javascript]
----
while (condition) {
  doAction()
}

do {
  action()
} while (condition)
----

=== For loops

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Not one, not two, but three different kinds of for loops:

Do not worry yourselves about the differences between the two last examples, it is not that important.
--

// .For Loops
[source, javascript]
----
for (var i = 0; i < size; i++) {
  use(i)
}
for (var property in object) {
  use(property)
}
for (var index of array) {
  use(index)
}
----

=== Branching

[NOTE.speaker]
--
In addition, javascript supports if-else statements, switch statements and labels, which are just a different name to
C's good old GOTO statements.

Now, how would a declarative piece of javascript code would look like? It would avoid control flow structures, but which?

If statements can only be replaces with the trianary operator, which is terse and difficult to read, so if-else are
likely to stay.

Switch statements are often used where pattern matching would have been used, and given there is no standarized
replacement for them, it would be difficult to compare them to something else.

Labels are rarely seen, so we are left with looping constructs.
--

.If-else
[source, javascript]
----
if (condition) {
  doSomething()
} else {
  doSomethingElse()
}
var a = condition ? val1 : val2
----

// [.float-right]
// NOTE: `undefined` is javascript's special way to spice up the old billion dollar mistake. Why use just "null" for
//       no-value when you can also use "undefined"?

.Switch statement
[source, javascript]
----
switch (response) {
  case "yes":
    return true
  case "no":
    return false
  default:
    return undefined
}
----

=== But Which?


=== Iteration functions

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Luckily for us, looping constructs do have good alternatives: The javascript Array object offers 4 familiar and useful
functions: `map`, `filter`, `forEach` and `reduce`. Here's a small examples of some of them:
--

`map`, `filter`, `forEach` and `reduce`

[%notitle]
=== Examples

|===================
| Imperative  | Declarative

a|
[source, javascript]
----
var result
for (var i of array) {
  result[i] = f(array[i])
}
----

a|
[source, javascript]
----
var result = array.map(f)
----

a|
[source, javascript]
----
var acc
for (var i of arr) {
  acc = f(acc, arr[i])
}
----

a|
[source, javascript]
----
var accumulated =
  arr.reduce(f)
----

|===================

=== Helper Libraries for Functional Programming

image::images/underscore.png[role="no-border"]

[.half]
image::images/lodash.png[role="float-left half no-border"]

[.half]
image::images/ramda.png[role="float-right half no-border"]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
These functions are built in as part of the Array API, and they have common alternative versions in utility libraries
such as `underscore`, `lodash` and `Ramda`. Combined with some built functions from the `Object` class, such as
`Object.keys` which returns an array of all keys, they are complete enough to represent most, if not all, iteration
constructs required by javascript developers.

Because of these properties I've decided that looping constructs are the best candidates for measuring how much does
Javascript adopts declarative programming.
--

== Part III: The Quest for Data

// Part III: The Quest for Data

image::images/adventure.jpg[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
I hope I did not bored you with this prolonged introduction. Armed with the understanding that while the question of
whether Javascript goes functional or not is complicated, the question of whether it becomes more declarative is easier
to answer. Now comes the search for data.
--

== Methods

[NOTE.speaker]
--
After consulting with Prof. Feitelson, I've decided to focus on projects which are:

By looking at how these projects evolve, we can gain insights into general trends in Javascript.
I've decided to use Github's one hundred most popular javascript projects, such as:
--

Projects which are:

[.step]
. Open source
. Have a lot of contributors
. Have been around for a while


[%notitle]
=== Project examples

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Next, I've gathered metadata on each project, such as it's number of stargazers and it's number of forks,
dependencies used and so on.

Finally, I've looked at the actual code. By selecting the last commit in each of the years 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018, I
would see into some of the trends in the overall Javascript programming style.

=== Terminology

Project = A repository on Github

Sample = Data on patterns from a project's snapshot

Sample Year = A sample from the specified year

=== Patterns: Imperative

[NOTE.speaker]
--
For each files of valid Javascript, I've looked for the following patterns:
--

- for loop, for..in loops, for..of loops

[source, javascript]
----
for (var i = 0; i < size; i++) {...}
for (var i in object) {...}
for (var i of array) {...}
----

- while and do-while loops

[source, javascript]
----
while (cond) {...}
----

=== Patterns: Declarative

- forEach calls

// [source, javascript]
// ----
// arr.forEach(f); _.forEach(arr, f); _.each(arr, f)
// ----

- map calls 

//  `map`, `pluck`, `flatMap`, `collect`

- filter calls 

//  `filter`, `select`, `reject`, `where`

- reduce calls

// `reduce`, `reduceRight`, `foldl`, `foldr`


[NOTE.speaker]
--
After filtering some problematic repositories, I moved into analyzing the results.
--

== The Sample

=== Projects

// .Projects in Each Sample year
image::images/num_projects_sample_year.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This graph shows how many samples we've managed to gather in each year, out of our initial one hundred repositories.
We had only 3 samples from 2009, so this year will be discarded in future graphs, and we had 79 samples in 2018.
--

// NOTE: Sample - a snapshot of a projects code at a specific time. Not all projects had samples at all times.

=== Projects by Age

// .Repositories by Age
image::images/created_year_cdf.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This brings the question of the age of the projects on Github. We can see that over half of them were created on Github
at before 2014. This means they have at least 5 years of development in the public domain, which is desired.

It is important to note that not all projects had samples in every year.
--

=== Size of Projects

// .Lines of code Per Sample Year
image::images/loc_files_per_sample_year.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
How large were the projects?

These two graphs show the total number of parsed Javascript files in each sample year, and the sum of lines of code for
each sample. We can see that we're dealing with magnitude of 3 million lines of code. We can also witness the rapid
growth of Javascript from 2012 to 2015, almost tripling the number of lines of code, while doubling the number of files.

We can see that from 2015 to 2018 the number of lines of code grows more slowly, but the number of files keeps on
growing steadily. This is an indication that code is broken into smaller files, maybe due to refactoring of the
projects?
--

== Results


image::images/cheers.jpg[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
--

=== Constructs in Samples

// .Number of Iteration Constructs in Each Year Sample
image::images/num_constructs_year.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Next, we'll look at the how common are different code constructs in different samples:

In this graph we see the count of each iteration construct across the three sample years. The top for are our impreative
constructs, `while`, `for..of`, `for..in` and C-style ``for``-loops. Beneath them are our declarative constructs:
`forEach`, `reduce`, `map` and `filter`. The green line is the sum of all declarative constructs.

We can notice that from 2015 to 2018 the total number of iteration constructs had stayed roughly the same, but we
already know that the amount of code had increased. We can also see that the declarative part is slightly raising, and
also that C-style `for` loops are the most popular interation construct.
--

=== Constructs per LoC

// .Number of Iteration Construct per Lines of Code
image::images/percent_constructs_year.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's look at the same data normalized by the number of lines of code in each sample:

In this graph it becomes obvious that as time advances, there are less iteration per line of code. Is that because
projects use APIs which are even more high-level than the ones I'm sampling, or is because there are less iterations
over data in general?

We can see that while the total number of iteration constructs shrink, the part of the declarative constructs
shrinks more slowly. Let's have a look at the relative amount of each construct compared to the others:
--

=== Constructs in Percentage

// .Percentage of Iteration Constructs over Years
image::images/dist_constructs_year.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Now, here we can see an obvious trend: declarative iteration constructs are on the rise compared to their imperative
counterparts. Still, they are only slightly more that 40% of total constructs use, with C-style `for` loops still in the
lead with 34% of all constructs found. `while` loops are slowly disappearing, dropping from 13% to just 9.6% over the
last 6 years, while the use of `map` is slowly on the rise. Surprisngly enough, the use of `reduce`, while rare, is
quite constants, being around 1% of all samples.

It seems like this supports the idea that javascript is moving to more declarative iteration constructs, but it seems
like this process is not as fast as I originally had guessed. Let's try and look what kind of projects change the
most.

=== Conclusions

[.fragment]
More Declarative Iterations!

[.fragment]
[small]#but not that much...#

=== Individual Projects

== Individual Projects

// .Ratio of Declarative Iterations per Project over Samples
image::images/decl_ratio_per_project_over_time.png[]

//Declarative Index: latexmath:[$\frac{Declarative}{Declarative + Imperative}$]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Sixty six of the projects appeared in more than one sample, meaning that we can track their individual development over
time. To do that, I started by defining the projects "Declarative Index", which is the ratio of declarative iteration
constructs out of the total number of constructs. A declarative index of "one" means that projects uses only declarative
iteration constructs, while a "zero" means that only imperative constructs are used.

I've proceeded with plotting the declarative index for each project over our sampled years. We can see that while most
projects create an upwards slope, meaning they go from imperative to declarative, this is not universally true.

I've plotted the mean declarative index as the magenta line, and we can see that over the last 6 years there's an
obvious trend where projects move to a higher declarative index, from approximately 0.4 in 2012 to almost 0.6 in 2018.

Is there anything that can predict whether a project will choose or turn to a more declarative style?
--

== What Kind of Projects Are Declarative?

=== Age as Estimator

// .Declarative Ratio by Project Age in Years
image::images/declarative_by_age.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
By plotting the declarative index of a project in the last sample in which it appears against different properties of
the project, we can hope to achieve some insight into which projects are more declarative.

In this graph we see the scatter of the projects index versus age and the regression line.

It seems like that the younger the project is, the more likely it is to have an higher declarative index! In other
words, newer projects tend to prefer a more declarative programming style.
--

=== Number of Forks

// .Declarative Ratio by Number of Project Forks
image::images/declarative_by_forks.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's consider the number of forks a project has and it's index.

If you are not familiar with github, a fork is a copy of the project with independent changes that might be merged back
into the project. In most projects, the only why for a contributor to contribute code is to first fork the project.

Again, we're look at the scatter-plot with regression. We can see that in this case the declarative index is slightly
inversely correlated with the number of forks.
--

// === Project Stargazers
// 
// // .Forks vs Stargazers
// image::images/forks_vs_stars.png[]
// 
// [NOTE.speaker]
// --
// What about the popularity of the project, represented by the number of "stargazers"? First, it is strongly correlated
// with number of forks, as evident from this graph, showing the scatter of forks versus stargazers.
// 
// So intuitively, I would expect it to be similar to the relation between the declarative index and the number of forks.
// Let's see:
// --

=== Stargazers vs. Index

// .Declarative Ratio by Stars
image::images/declarative_by_stars.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Interestingly enough, there is no correlation! But I wouldn't put to much meaning into this graph, because being a
stargazer of a project doesn't have some inherent well understood meaning, similar to a "like" on twitter or Facebook.

Finally, let's see how the number of contributors correlates with the projects "declarative index":
--

=== Project Contributors

// .Declarative Ratio by Number of Contributors
image::images/declarative_by_contributors.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Last property of project we'll see today is the number of contributors, as reported by the projects main Github page.

From the number of contributors we can see that there is some correlation between more contributors and more declarative
style of code. This might imply that the majority of JavaScript programmers prefer a declarative style of coding.
--


=== Conclusions


== Supporting Libraries

[NOTE.speaker]
--
As we discussed earlier, the question of measuring "functional programming" of a project is more complicated. A possible
indication can be the use of libraries that make a functional programming style more accessible in JavaScript, such as
"underscore", "lodash" and "Ramda".

By looking at the dependencies of different projects, we can see whether they use one of these libraries or not. This
graph shows the number of projects in each sample that had such a library as a dependency. We can see that while these
libraries are on the rise, they are still being used in less than a quarter of the projects.

// .Helper Libraries Use
image::images/helpers_libs.png[]

////
NOTE: Helper libraries provide high level API over data structures, for example a "groupby" function over fields, or
"mapValues" that can be used to map object values. Some of them, like Ramda, use conventions popular in languages such
Haskell and Elm

// === Immutability

// image::images/static-land.png[role="half float-right no-border"]
// image::images/immutablejs.png[role="no-border"]
// 
// [NOTE.speaker]
// --
// There are some libraries which provide facilities for immutable data structures in JavaScript, and some libraries for
// advance data structures, such as Algebraic Data Types. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any project in any sample who used
// such a library.

=== What are your options?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Oh! Well, if you don't like Javascript but need to write code that runs in a web browser there are several nice
alterantives:

Elm: a small delightful language that IMHO solves many of the problems in web programming

ClojureScrip:  if you just can live another project without LISP

PureScript: a Haskell-like language that compiles to Javascript and has some tweeks for nicer interpolation with
Javascript.

Reason: an OCaml inspired language that started trending lately, mostly due to it's easy interop with Javascript.

Wait for the Web assembly standard to mature and then just write code in whatever languae you want.

100s of Language X to Javascripts: Hundreds of other programming languages that can compile themselves to Javascript,
such as Haskell, Kotlin, Scala, Ruby, Python. 

Google any word with "Script" as suffix or that is a pun on coffee and there's probably a Javascript dialect or a
language that transpiles to Javascript by that name.

=== As for me...

image::images/road.jpg[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]

As for my research, there are some obvious steps forward:

- The most obvious is to look at a larger sample.
- I can also look at other structures, such as assignments and branching.
- It might be possible to identify the uses of higher-order functions.
- Or just examine specific examples in more detail, for example, determining how easy it is to refactor code from
  imperative to declarative style.
- We can look at changes over time at the commit level: is code being refactored?
- And finally, we can see whether projects migrate to functional languages.

And of course, there are so many small improvements to make, such as supporting more flavors of JavaScript, and even
looking at JavaScript's typed superset, TypeScript.

- Look at a larger sample
- Examine more structures, e.g. assignments
- Look at the use of higher-order functions
- Examine results into more detail.
- Examine changes of code over time
- Look for projects migrating from Javascript to functional languages
